# ❄️ Snowflake Email Notification Module

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a **production-ready and SnowPro Core–aligned** approach to sending email notifications in **Snowflake** using:
- **Alerts**
- **Notification Integrations (EMAIL)**
- **SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL**

This module is designed for **beginners to intermediate learners**, while remaining **interview- and certification-safe**.

---

## What This Module Solves
Snowflake does **not** support SMTP or ad‑hoc email sending.  
Instead, it provides **governed, event-driven notifications**.

This module shows how to:
- Detect a data condition (e.g., zero rows, threshold breach)
- Trigger an alert on a schedule
- Send an email securely to **whitelisted recipients**

## How to Use This Module

1. Open **Snowflake Worksheets**
2. Execute the SQL lab:
   ```
   sql/email_alert_lab.sql
   ```
3. Ensure the alert is **RESUMED**
4. Wait for the schedule interval
5. Verify email delivery

## Key Concepts Covered

| Concept | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Alert | Evaluates a SQL condition on a schedule |
| Notification Integration | Governs who can receive emails |
| SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL | Sends the email when triggered |

---

## Common Mistakes (Exam Traps)

- Assuming Snowflake supports SMTP ❌
- Sending email without a Notification Integration ❌
- Forgetting to RESUME the alert ❌
- Treating SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL as a standalone feature ❌

---

## Certification & Interview Relevance

This module maps directly to **SnowPro Core** topics:
- Alerts
- Notification Integrations
- Security & Governance
- Automation patterns

---

## Who This Is For

- Snowflake beginners
- SnowPro Core aspirants
- Data Engineers & Architects
- Anyone implementing governed alerting in Snowflake
